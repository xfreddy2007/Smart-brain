## Getting Started 🚀

First acces in the website, there is a sign in form and a register form. We collect user information and store them in the database. After login the website, a block requires a image url for face detection. you can paste an image ends with .jpg, and it will show a box which indicates the location of the face in the image. It also counts the image detect times that a user has done, and store in the database.

## API Selection

I choose to use Clarifai face recognition API (url:https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection), it is easy to use and understand. The request of this api is an image url, and the response is called "bounding_box" values, which are the coordinates of the box outlining each face within the image. For the blue box shown in the image detection result is a CSS pixel calculation.

## Why React?

React is a Front-End Frameworrk, and it has many advantages such as modulized components, easy maintenance, etc. Most important, it is easy to pick up and is popular throughout recent front-end environment (Vue.js is like an elevator with nowadays). For the above reasons, I choose to use React for this practice project.

## Why PostgreSQL

There are plenty of database selections. I need a structured database so NoSQL, MongoDB won't be good choices. I choose to use PostgreSQL is that I have used before and it is not hard to implement.

## Why Node.js & Express.js

I am not familiar with backend environment so I choose a language that is similar to what I've learn now, and it comes Node.js and Express.js. Although some other languages such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, or Go. They all have their advantages. Further research is required for later projects.
